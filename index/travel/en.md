## Accommodation for Chicago Vacation

Note that the Courtyard Marriott Hotel recommended for the Wedding Weekend, and most of the Wedding Weekend Program events, are in the Chicago Suburbs. If you are planning a vacation to see Chicago in the days before or after the wedding weekend, this hotel is not ideal for staying longer than the weekend because it is not in the city. We recommend seeking out other hotels in the city or use AirBnB to find someplace to stay closer to the cityâ€™s attractions.

We would recommend finding an AirBnB or hotel somewhere in the [Lincoln Park neighborhood](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lincoln+Park,+Chicago,+IL,+USA), which gives access to the [Metra train](https://metrarail.com/metra/en/home.html) and the [L](http://www.transitchicago.com/maps/) (Chicago's subway) for getting everywhere from downtown to the beautiful northern suburbs to the hip neighborhoods on the west side of town.
