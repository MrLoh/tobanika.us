## Using Public Transit in Chicago

The [L](http://www.transitchicago.com/riding_cta/how_to_guides/ridingthetrain.aspx) is Chicago's elevated (L-evated) train system which connects you to everything around the city (including the [Art Institute](../program#art) and [US Cellular Field](../program#baseball) for Wedding Weekend events).  There are also [city buses](http://www.transitchicago.com/riding_cta/how_to_guides/ridingthebus.aspx) which take you everywhere else in between, or in case you need a break from walking. There is also a [bus tracker](http://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/home.jsp) for finding when the next bus will reach your station. Both the bus and L are run by the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority), and you can find a map of the bus and L routes [here](http://www.transitchicago.com/travel_information/maps/default.aspx?source_quicklinks=1).

You will need to get a [Ventra card](https://www.ventrachicago.com) for paying for public transportation in Chicago. The Ventra card costs $5.00 up front, but if you register the card online you get those $5.00 as credit to your account. Money can be added online once you register the card and make an account, or at the machine at the station. A one-way ride is $2.25 ($1.10 for children ages 7-11 or 11-17 with student ID, free for children under 7), and transfers are an extra $0.25 each. You can pay with exact change on the bus only, otherwise you need to use the Ventra card for bus or L travel. You can also get short-term, disposable passes at $3.00 one-way ($5 from O'Hare) or $10 for a day pass. Find more info about ticket fares [here](http://www.transitchicago.com/fares/).

## Accommodations for Chicago Vacation

Note that the Courtyard Marriott Hotel recommended for the Wedding Weekend, and most of the Wedding Weekend Program events, are in the Chicago Suburbs. If you are planning a vacation to see Chicago in the days before or after the wedding weekend, this hotel might not be ideal for staying longer than the weekend because it is not in the city. We recommend seeking out other hotels in the city or use [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Chicago--IL?s_tag=s-NqqC-U) to find someplace to stay closer to the cityâ€™s attractions if you are staying an extended length of time to see Chicago. That being said, you can reach the center of the city by [Metra train](https://metrarail.com/metra/en/home.html) and the [L](http://www.transitchicago.com/maps/) from this hotel in an hour and for $6.25, so if you are just staying for a couple extra days, then maybe it is not worth to move to a different hotel.

We would recommend finding an AirBnB or hotel somewhere in the [Lincoln Park neighborhood](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lincoln+Park,+Chicago,+IL,+USA), which gives access to the Metra for getting everywhere from downtown to the beautiful northern suburbs to the hip neighborhoods on the west side of town.
