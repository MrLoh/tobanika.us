## Getting Around Chicago

The [L](http://www.transitchicago.com/riding_cta/how_to_guides/ridingthetrain.aspx) is Chicago's elevated (L-evated) train system which connects you to everything around the city (including the [Art Institute](../program#art) and [US Cellular Field](../program#baseball) for Wedding Weekend events).  There are also [city buses](http://www.transitchicago.com/riding_cta/how_to_guides/ridingthebus.aspx) which take you everywhere else in between, or in case you need a break from walking. There is also a [bus tracker](http://www.ctabustracker.com/bustime/home.jsp) for finding when the next bus will reach your station.

You will need to get a Ventra card for paying for public transportation in Chicago.

## Accommodation for Chicago Vacation

Note that the Courtyard Marriott Hotel recommended for the Wedding Weekend, and most of the Wedding Weekend Program events, are in the Chicago Suburbs. If you are planning a vacation to see Chicago in the days before or after the wedding weekend, this hotel is not ideal for staying longer than the weekend because it is not in the city. We recommend seeking out other hotels in the city or use AirBnB to find someplace to stay closer to the cityâ€™s attractions.

We would recommend finding an AirBnB or hotel somewhere in the [Lincoln Park neighborhood](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lincoln+Park,+Chicago,+IL,+USA), which gives access to the [Metra train](https://metrarail.com/metra/en/home.html) and the [L](http://www.transitchicago.com/maps/) for getting everywhere from downtown to the beautiful northern suburbs to the hip neighborhoods on the west side of town.
