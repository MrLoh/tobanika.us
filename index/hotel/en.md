## What

We have reserved a block of rooms at the Courtyard Marriott Chicago Highland Park/Northbrook Hotel for out-of-town guests to find a place to stay for the weekend of the wedding.  The block of rooms is called the Williams/Lohse Wedding Room Block and is held for the nights from Wednesday, September 7th through Sunday, September 11th.


## Why

This hotel is convenient for getting home from the Reception and for attending the [Weekend Program](../program?lang=en) events we have planned for the wedding weekend, so we highly encourage all guests in need of a hotel to stay here.  At the minimum you should stay here for the evening of Friday, September 9th, because at midnight after the Reception we will have an After Party in the hotel lounge. This hotel also offers a free shuttle to anywhere within 5 miles (8km) of the hotel, which includes the Chicago Botanic Gardens and Ravinia Park for the wedding weekend events!


## Where

The hotel is located at [1505 Lake Cook Road, Highland Park, IL 60035](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Courtyard+Chicago+Highland+Park%2FNorthbrook).  Please note that there is a second Marriott Courtyard Hotel on this same street, so note the name of the correct hotel: Courtyard Marriott Chicago Highland Park/Northbrook.

The hotel is about an hour from downtown Chicago (10 minutes with shuttle to train station, 50 minutes on train to Ogilvie Transportation Center).  Getting to the hotel directly from O’Hare Airport will take about 25 minutes with a car.


## How

Room reservations can be made via phone at +1 866-381-4803 (be sure to specify the Williams-Lohse Wedding Room Block) or online: [Book your group rate](http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=Williams/Lohse%20Wedding%20Group%20Room%20Block%5Echihp%60wlwwlwa%7Cwlwwlwb%60109.00%60USD%60false%604%609/8/16%609/11/16%6008/18/2016&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes) for Williams/Lohse Wedding Group Room Blocks

Reservations must be made on or before Thursday, August 18th, as this is the Cutoff Date for the Room Block.

The hotel block has two different types of rooms:

Rooms with 1 King bed + 1 Sofa bed - max 3 adults (or 2 adults and 2 children)

![](king_room_floorplan.png)

Rooms with 2 Queen beds - max 4 adults (or 4 adults and 1 crib)

![](queen_room_floorplan.png)

Both room styles cost $121 per night (including tax).  (Divided by 4 people, that’s just $30 (€27) per night per person!)

If you are looking for other people to share a hotel room, please contact Lauren ([maidofhonor@tobanika.us](mailto:maidofhonor@tobanika.us)) to find potential roommates.


## Getting Around

The hotel offers a free shuttle to hotel guests within a 5-mile (8-km) radius, which includes the [Braeside](http://metrarail.com/content/metra/en/home/maps_schedules/metra_system_map/up-n/map.html) or [Lake Cook Road](http://metrarail.com/content/metra/en/home/maps_schedules/metra_system_map/md-n/map.html) Metra train stations (ideal for reaching downtown Chicago) and the Chicago Botanic Garden and Ravinia Park (wedding weekend Program events for Saturday).

We will be hiring a shuttle for hotel guests without access to a car for the day of the wedding.  It will take guests from the hotel to Libertyville Covenant Church for the ceremony, then to the Kenilworth Club for the reception, and back to the hotel in the evening.  Please indicate on your RSVP card if you will be needing this service.  We will inform you of an exact shuttle schedule when you check into the hotel.

## Getting to the Hotel

If you are coming directly to the hotel from O’Hare Airport, the hotel manager has given us some helpful information regarding taxis from the airport to the hotel:  

When you arrive at the airport and after you have collected your bags, you can call [American Taxi](https://www.americantaxi.com/ATOnlineOrderWeb/main.htm) (+1 847-255-9600) who will give you the taxi number to look for and instructions on where to pick it up. Additionally, there are 30+ phones marked "American Taxi" in the baggage claim areas at O'Hare. You can ask at the airport when you pick up your bags where to find one of these so you can order a taxi if you don't have a working cell phone.

American Taxi has a flat fee from the airport to the Courtyard Marriott hotel of about $34 dollars for a regular taxi (vans are about $10 more).   This is important to note because there is a difference between Chicago city taxis and Chicago suburban taxis.  American Taxi is a suburban taxi service, while city taxis include a huge surcharge to deliver to suburban addresses (ending up at $80 for the same trip to the hotel).  The first taxi you see at the airport, picking up passengers at the curb, is probably a city taxi so it is best to order a taxi ahead of time via phone.

Here are the pickup locations of American Taxi at each terminal for O'Hare Airport:

- Terminal 1: Pick Up Door G on baggage claim level, middle lane of traffic.
- Terminal 2: Pick Up Door E on baggage claim level, middle lane of traffic.
- Terminal 3: Pick Up Door G on baggage claim level, middle lane of traffic.
- International Terminal 5: Pick Up Door E on baggage claim level, first lane of traffic.

## Accommodation for Chicago Vacation

Note that this hotel, and most of the wedding weekend events, are in the Chicago Suburbs. If you are planning a vacation to see Chicago in the days before or after the wedding weekend, this hotel might not be ideal for staying longer than the weekend because it is not in the city. Visit the [Travel](../travel?lang=en#chicagoaccomodation) page for more information and suggestions on this topic.
