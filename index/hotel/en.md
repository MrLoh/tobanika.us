## What:
We have reserved a block of rooms at the Courtyard Marriott Chicago Highland Park/Northbrook Hotel for out-of-town guests to find a place to stay for the weekend of the wedding.  The block of rooms is called the Williams/Lohse Wedding Room Block and is held for the nights of Thursday, September 8th through Saturday, September 10th.

## Where:
The hotel is located at 1505 Lake Cook Road, Highland Park, Illinois 60035.  Please note that there is a second Marriott Courtyard Hotel on this same street, so note the name of the correct hotel: Courtyard Marriott Chicago Highland Park/Northbrook.

The hotel is about an hour from downtown Chicago (10 minutes with shuttle to train station, 50 minutes on train to Ogilvie Transportation Center).  Getting to the hotel directly from Oâ€™Hare Airport will take about 25 minutes with a car.

## How:
Room reservations can be made via phone at +1 866-381-4803 (be sure to specify the Williams-Lohse Wedding Room Block) or online:
