![](church.jpg)
Libertyville Covenant Church <br>
[250 S St. Mary's Rd, Libertyville, IL 60048](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Libertyville+Covenant+Church)

We want to get married in front of our friends and family as a witness to the role you all have played, and continue to play, in our lives.  We will be married by two pastors, one German and one American, who have been important to each of us.  Please come witness our marriage and then join us for a large group photo afterwards in front of the church.

### Wedding Reception

Join us in celebrating our marriage as we enjoy a delicious vegetarian dinner together, which will leave you feeling full and not guilty. Dinner will be followed by dancing and the German tradition of games and performances by guests. In this tradition, guests plan games to play, involving audience members or just the Bride and Groom.  Little performances — such as funny songs, skits, or stories — are also welcome. Please contact Jannis ([bestman@tobanika.us](mailto:bestman@tobanika.us)) if you would like to help plan a game or performance during the reception party.

Please bring food and drink, as we will be picnicking together before the show begins.  Join us at 5:30 PM to hang out and dine before the show starts at 7:00 PM.

The cost is $15 for students (including university and PhD students, valid only with student ID which indicates an expiration date).  Children under 15 are free.

Walk past the famous bronze lions and enter a great museum with some amazing art, including the Chagall window, Impressionist and Expressionist paintings, Edward Hopper's [Nighthawks](http://wikiwand.com/en/Nighthawks), and some miniature dollhouse rooms (little Anika's favorite exhibit).

If you don’t know much about baseball, this is your chance to have a great American experience and learn how the game is played.  Baseball games are a great background for socializing, drinking beer, and eating hotdogs.  No need to worry about standing and cheering for several hours.  Be sure to wear black and white!  And absolutely no red!
