![](baseballfield.jpg)
US Cellular Field

Join us for a classic ballgame between Anika’s favorite team, the Chicago White Sox, and the Cleveland Indians.  If you don’t know much about baseball, this is your chance to have a great American experience and learn how the game is played.  Baseball games are a great background for socializing, drinking beer, and eating hotdogs.  No need to worry about standing and cheering for several hours.  Be sure to wear black and white!  And absolutely no red!
